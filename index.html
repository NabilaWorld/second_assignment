            <h1 class="scroll-head">Activate the Hidden Power of Your Introversion</h1>

            <div class="scroll">
                <p class="scroll-paragraph">A number of factors help shape the unique characteristics that make you who you are, and these factors can also affect the ways introversion shows up in your personality. To put it another way, no two introverts are exactly alike.

                    That said, you might recognize introversion in yourself by some of the following traits and behaviors.Do you consider periods of solitude essential for optimal health and well-being? Maybe you find the thought of a quiet night at home positively delightful, whether you plan to spend that time simply resting or enjoying a quiet hobby on your own.

                    Mild or severe, interpersonal conflict is a natural outcome of human interaction. People have very different personalities, values, expectations, and attitudes toward problem-solving. When you work or interact with someone who doesn’t share your opinions or goals, conflict can result.
                    
                    
                    In broad terms, conflict happens when two or more people disagree. You might experience verbal conflict, such as an argument, or nonverbal conflict, which might involve someone turning their back or walking away from you.
                    
                    No matter how conflict shakes out, you can identify it as one of these six types.
                    Pseudo conflict
                    
                    A pseudo conflict typically happens in one of the following situations:
                    
                        A misunderstanding leads to a difference of opinion.
                        The people involved in the conflict believe they have different goals when, in reality, they have similar goals.
                        When one person involved in the conflict mocks or taunts the other (sometimes called badgering). 
                    
                    In most cases, you can resolve pseudo conflict without too much trouble. It generally just takes a bit of clarification about what you actually meant or some further exploration of how your goals actually do align.
                    
                    Most people don’t enjoy being teased, especially in front of other people, so you may also need to talk through badgering or teasing behavior.
                    Fact conflict
                    
                    You’re utterly convinced snakes can hear, but your friend insists they can’t because they don’t have ears.
                    
                    This illustrates a fact conflict, also called simple conflict. Fact conflict happens when two or more people disagree over information or the truth of something.
                    
                    Because this kind of conflict involves facts, you can often resolve it pretty easily. All you have to do is check a credible source for the truth.
                    Value conflict
                    
                    This kind of conflict comes up when different personal values lead to disagreement.
                    
                    If you and a coworker have different views on abortion rights, for example, or you and your brother have different religious beliefs, you might find yourself in a value conflict.
                    
                
                    
                   </p>
